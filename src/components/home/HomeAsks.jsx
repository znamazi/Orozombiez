                0.66% of the secondary sales goes to the community pool, where
                we will run votes on where we should spend the money: community
                collection NFTs (Apes, Punks, CoolCats, etc.), charity
                donations, ETH airdrops or giveaways &amp; many more

              <HomeAsksInfoItem>
                0.5% goes to the team, to keep up motivation, cashflow &amp;
                ideas to push this project forward, and make the community
                better and stronger everyday

              Also: After we are sold out, we will fund the community wallet
              with 66.6 ETH to kick the Community Collection off
